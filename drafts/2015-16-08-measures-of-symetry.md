 Generalizing the idea of "symmetric distribution" from 1D to multivariate is quite interesting and not trivial.
 
Here are some possible generalizetions:

## Spherical Symmetry
$$ X - \theta \sim A (X - \theta) $$
For a rotation matrix $A$.

## Elliptical Symmetry



## Central Symmetry
A.k.a. "reflectively" or "diagonally" or "simply" or "antipodally" symmetric:
$$ X - \theta \sim \theta - X $$


## Angular Symmetry
