Probably the most valuable tip when learning something new, is "what to read?"
Here is a (partial) list of the books I found most valuable in my research.

1. Cox, D. R. __Principles of Statistical Inference__. 
A high level, almost philosophical text, on the basic ideas in statistics. Possibly the most important, in this list, but make sure you read it last. 

2. Wasserman, Larry. __All of Statistics__: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference. 
A one stop shop for almost all of the fundamental ideas in statistics.

3. van der Vaart, A. W. __Asymptotic Statistics__. 
Much, if not most, of classical statistics is asymptotic. 
This book can serve both as an introduction, and as a technical reference for the vast realm of asymptotic statistics.

4. Hastie, T, R Tibshirani, and JH Friedman. __The Elements of Statistical Learning__. 
A one stop shop for machine learning, cast in statistical terminology.

5. Tsybakov, A. B. __Introduction to Nonparametric Estimation__. 
My favorite reference on non parametric statistics.

6. Greene, William H. __Econometric Analysis__. 
My favorite reference on the analysis of linear models. 
The economic orientation adds very useful applied motivation, and an emphasis on causal inference rarely seen in the statistical literature.

8. Grimmett, Geoffrey R., and David R. Stirzaker. __Probability and Random Processes__. 
An excellent introductory textbook to probability and stochastic processes.

9. Cover, T. M., and Joy A. Thomas. __Elements of Information Theory__. 
As the name suggests, your one stop shop for information theory.

10. Wilcox, Rand R. __Introduction to Robust Estimation and Hypothesis Testing__. 
A very well written exposition of the vast world of robust statistics. 
A must read with whoever works with actual data, and not only theory. 

11. Robert E. Weiss. __Modelling Longitudinal Data__. My favorite reference on the topic. 

12. James E. Gentle. __Numerical Linear Algebra for Applications in Statistics__. Because we may write $A^{-1}b=x$, but a computer would never invert a matrix to solve this problem. 

Feel free to use this list, and recommend more entries.
