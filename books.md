Probably the most valuable tip when learning something new, is "what to read?"
Here is a (partial) list of the books I found most valuable in my research.

1. Cox, D. R. __Principles of Statistical Inference__. 
A high level, almost philosophical text, on the basic ideas in statistics. Possibly the most important, in this list, but make sure you read it last. 

2. Wasserman, Larry. __All of Statistics__: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference. 
A one stop shop for almost all of the fundamental ideas in statistics.

3. van der Vaart, A. W. __Asymptotic Statistics__. 
Much, if not most, of classical statistics is asymptotic. 
This book can serve both as an introduction, and as a technical reference for the vast realm of asymptotic statistics.

4. Hastie, T, R Tibshirani, and JH Friedman. __The Elements of Statistical Learning__. 
A one stop shop for machine learning, cast in statistical terminology.

4. Hodges, J.S. __Richly parameterized linear models: additive, time series, and spatial models using random effects__. Linking random-effects, Bayesian statistics, geo-statistics, and time-series. I wish someone had told me of this book sooner!

5. Tsybakov, A. B. __Introduction to Nonparametric Estimation__. 
My favorite reference on non parametric statistics.

6. Greene, William H. __Econometric Analysis__. 
My favorite reference on the analysis of linear models. 
The economic orientation adds very useful applied motivation, and an emphasis on causal inference rarely seen in the statistical literature.

8. Grimmett, Geoffrey R., and David R. Stirzaker. __Probability and Random Processes__. 
An excellent introductory textbook to probability and stochastic processes.

9. Guttorp, Peter, and Vladimir N. Minin. __Stochastic Modeling of Scientific Data__. 
Excellent reference on modeling strategies and stochastic processes. 

9. Robert M. Gray. __Entropy and Information Theory__.
As the name suggests, your one stop shop for information theory.
I like it better than Cover's book. 

10. Wilcox, Rand R. __Introduction to Robust Estimation and Hypothesis Testing__. 
A very well written exposition of the vast world of robust statistics. 
A must read with whoever works with actual data, and not only theory. 

11. Robert E. Weiss. __Modelling Longitudinal Data__. My favorite reference on the topic. 

13. Venables, W.N. and Ripley, B.D. __Modern Applied Statistics with S__. Everything you need to actually analyze data in R. 

14. Rasmussen, C.E and Williams C.K.I. __Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning__. 
The first time I felt I understand RKHS.

15. Bai, Z., and Silverstein, J.W. __Spectral Analysis of Large Dimensional Random Matrices__. 
For random matrix theory.

16. Allard, D. and Chilès, J.P. and Delfiner P. __Geostatistics: Modeling Spatial Uncertainty__. 
As the name suggests.

17. Kenneth Lange. __Numerical analysis for statisticians__. 
An excellent reference on numerical analysis and algorithms.

24. Solomon, Justin. __Numerical algorithms: methods for computer vision, machine learning, and graphics__. A complete, and well written exposition of many numerical algorithms. 


18. Nahmias, S. and Cheng, Y. __Production and Operations Analysis__. 
One-stop-shop for industrial statistics and industrial engineering.

19. Cano, E.L. and Moguerza, J.M. and Redchuk, A. __Six sigma with R: statistical engineering for process improvement__. For 
statistical process control.

20. Cox, D.R. and Reid, N. __The Theory of the Design of Experiments__. For DOE.

21. Anderson, T.W. __An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis__.

22. __The Princeton Companion to Applied Mathematics__. For short, readable, and authoritative explanations of EVERYTHING in applied mathematics. 

23. Bryant, R.E., and O'Hallaron D.R. __Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective__. 
If you want to know how a computer works, for the purpose of programming (not maintaining it). 

24. Brian Ward. __How Linux Works: 2n Edition__.
A SUPERB reference on Linux, networking, and how computers work. 
Superb, superb, superb. 


25. Raftery, Adrian E., Martin T. Wells, and Martin A. Tanner. __Statistics in the 21st Century__. An excellent overview of the state of statistical research at the end of the 20th century. Including excellent topic overviews, and open research questions. 

26. Peter Godfrey-Smith. __Theory and Reality__. An excellent introduction to the philosophy of science. 

27. Steven Smith. __Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists__. A comprehensive and application oriented presentation of DSP (turns out it is more than non-parametric regression with complex numbers!).

28. Peter J. Schreier and Louis L. Scharf. __Statistical Signal Processing of Complex-Valued Data: The Theory of Improper and Noncircular Signals__ .
In the case you are wondering, like myself, "why are so many scientists obsessed with complex numbers?".

29. Jake VanderPlas. __Python Data Science Handbook__. Best reference for learning data-oriented Python.
