Gave a guest lecture on dimensionality reduction at [Amir Geva's](http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~geva/) "Clustering and Unsupervised Computer Learning" graduate course.
I tried to give a quick overview of major dimensionality reduction algorithms. 
In particular, I like to present algorithms via the problem they are __aimed__ to solve, and not via __how__ they solve it.
