After thinking about it a long time, I finally decided to create a blog of my own.
Learning of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) markdown for interpreting  [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) made the difference, as I can now easily post with all the mathematical detail I want. 
[Barry Clark's](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) guide really helped me getting started.
I can event edit `RMarkdown` in `RStudio`, outputting text and images, and automatically publish on [Github](https://github.com/). 
I did not try this exciting pipeline yet, but it is documented by  [Andy South](http://andysouth.github.io/blog-setup/).

Well, if you are interested on my thoughts on statistics and `R`, you may consider adding this feed to your RSS reader. 

## What to Expect 

Future posts will include:

- An intro to the underlying concepts of machines learning. Taken from [my course at BGU](https://github.com/johnros/Intro2R).
- A mass of research ideas I have, and I know I will never have time to attend.
- Random thoughts about `R`. Probably with some code.
