After thinking about it a long time, I finally decided to create a blog of my own.
Learning of `Jekyll` with `MathJax` made the difference, as I can now easily post with all the mathematical detail I want. See [here](http://christopherpoole.github.io/using-mathjax-on-github-pages/) for more details.

I can event edit `RMarkdown` in `RStudio`, outputting text and images, and automatically publish on [Github](https://github.com/). 
I did not try this exciting pipeline yet, but it is documented [here](http://andysouth.github.io/blog-setup/).

Well, if you are interested on my thoughts on statistics and `R`, you may consider adding this feed to your RSS reader. 
I will now think of something to actually blog about.
