Now that I am a member of the [Industrial Engineering Dept.](http://in.bgu.ac.il/engn/iem/Pages/default.aspx) at Ben Gurion University, I am naturally looking into statistical aspects of Industrial Engineering. In particular process control.
This being the case, I started teaching Quality Engineering. 
While preparing the course, I read the classical introductory literature and I felt it failed to convey the beauty of the field, by focusing on too many little details. 
I thus went ahead and wrote my own book, which can be found [online](https://github.com/johnros/qualityEngineering/blob/master/Class_notes/notes.pdf).

How does it differ from existing literature:
 
- Being an introductory text it has a very wide scope of topics. The focus is on the underlying ideas and terminology, and details are given in the references. 
- Topics covered: History of quality engineering, exploratory data analysis, process control charts, design of experiments, acceptance sampling, and reliability. 
- The design of experiments and reliability chapters have much wider scopes then typically found in quality engineering textbooks. 
- I read many books and papers while researching the literature, and I tried to bring the most recent and clear references to each topic. 

I hope readers will find my notes useful.
Being experimental, they may still contain mistakes. I would be very thankful to whoever decides to inform me of any mistakes found.
