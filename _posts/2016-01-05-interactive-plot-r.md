[Efrat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/efratvilenski) is a MSc. student in my group.
She works on integrating advanced Multivariate Process Control capabilities in interactive dashboards.
During her work she aquired an impressive expertise in interactive plotting with R, and [D3JS](http://d3js.org/).

Yesterday, 2016-3-01, she gave a workshop on the topic for the [The Israeli Statistical Association](http://www.statistics.org.il/). 
About 60 participants attended the Google Campus at Tel Aviv to hear about R, plotting, and JavaScript.

Her slides, code and links, can be found [here](http://efratvil.github.io/R-Israel-Jan-2015/links.html).
