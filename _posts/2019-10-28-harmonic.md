The _Harmonic-Mean p-value_ (HMP), as the name suggests, is the harmonic mean of p-values. 
It can replace other aggregations, such as [Fisher's combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_method)
and be used as a test-statistic for  _signal detection_, a.k.a. _global global null testing_.
It is an elegant test statistic: it is easy to compute, and it's null distribution can be easily derived for independent tests. 
It is thus a useful tool for signal-detection/meta-analysis.

Our interest in the HMP began with Daniel Wilson's PNAS paper [1].
In there, and the accopmanying [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harmonic_mean_p-value&oldid=921890236), Wilson claims the following properties of the HMP:

1. The HMP offers strong FWER control.
1. The HMP is a more powerful test than Bonferonni and Simes'. 
1. The HMP is valid when p-values are statistically dependent.

Let's parse them one at a time:

Regarding __Strong FWER control__:
_Strong FWER control_ means that the probability of a false positive is under control, even in the presence of signal in some of the variables.
This is not true for the HMP, because the null distribution of the HMP would differ in the presence of some signal. 
_Weak FWER control_ means that the probability of a false positive is under control, only if no variable carries signal. 
Wilson, however, does show that HMP offers more than weak FWER control.
Because HMP is decreasing as more hypotheses are interscted, this means that if HMP rejects some conjunction hypothesis, then all the hypotheses in the closure of the conjunction will also be rejected. 
Wilson calles it _strong control_, but I think that _"weak FWER contorl in selected subsets"_ may be more accurate. 

Here is a formal definition, followed by an example. 
Denote $$B$$ a set of $$m$$ null-hypotheses, $$m_1(B)$$ the number of false-nulls (i.e., signals, effects, associations,...), in $$B$$, and $$V$$ the number of false rejections of some inference algorithm, such as HMP.
_Weak FWER_ means that if $$m_1(B)=0$$ then $$P(V(B)>0)\leq \alpha.$$
_Strong FWER_ means that $$\forall m_1(B), P(V(B)>0)\leq \alpha.$$
_Weak FWER in the Selected_ means that if $$P(\exists R_i: m_1(R_i)=0)\leq \alpha,$$ where $$R_i$$ denotes a rejected hypothesis.

Here is an example in genetics.
Based on SNP-wise p-values, a resercher declares genes A and B as significant.
_Weak FWER_ means the inference is valid only if there is no effects/associations anywhere in A, nor B, nor any other SNP outside of $$A \cup B$$.
_Weak FWER in the selected_ means the inference is valid if there is no effects/associations anywhere in A,B. Effects/associations that are outside $$A \cup B$$ are allowed.
_Strong FWER_ means that inference __on SNPs__, within $$A \cup B$$ is valid, even in the presence of true asociated SNPs within $$A \cup B$$.
Readers familiar with neuroimaging will recognize this weak-FWER, has the same guarantees as the _Topological Inference_ performed with random field theory.


Regarding __HMP vs. Bonferoni__: We do not see how a global test like HMP can be compared to Bonferonni corrected multiple tests. 
Regarding HMP vs. Simes: The comparison in [1] is an unfair one. When all elementary hypotheses are tested, then Simes is more powerful than HMP. 
We show this in [2].

Regarding validity under __dependence__: 
Wilson argues, both in [1] and in his [Wikipedia edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extensions_of_Fisher%27s_method&oldid=901235957), that HMP is valid under arbitrary statistical dependencies between p-values. 
While there may be dependencies that do not invalidate the HMP false-positive rates, a simple simulation under compound-symmetry revals that the HMP is not valid under dependence. 
Does theory support Wilson's claim?
Yes and no.
On the one hand, the distribution of harmonic means does tend to be robust to dependence.
This is because the harmonic mean is driven by the smaller entries; in the Gaussian case, where dependence=correlations, the smaller entries roughly behave like white noise. 
On the other hand, it was not to hard to design an example where false positive control is invalidated, as we show in [2].

All of the above does not mean the HMP is useless. 
Far from it.
Goeman and Solari [3] show how to estimate the signal's prevalence, with strong FWER control, by embedding a global test in a closed testing procedure. 
In Rosenblatt et al. [4] discussed in a [previous blog post](http://www.john-ros.com/cherry-brain/), we showed how we used this idea to estimate the amount of brain activation in selected regions. 
Ebrahimpoor et al. [5] use the same ratioanle to infer on the proportion of asociated SNPs within genes. 
While the type of correlations in brain scans and genomes may (possibly) invalidate error guarantees, this embedding is still of value in many other applications. 

We thus conclude that HMP and closed testing have great potential, but it has to be handeled with more care than implied in [1].
