If you want use `R` and: 
your data does not fit in your hard disk, or
you want to do some ad-hoc distributed computations, or
you need 256 GB of RAM for fitting your model, or
you want your data to be accesible from anywhere in the world, or
you heard about "AWS" and want to know how it may help your statistical needs...
Then it is time to remind you of an [old post](http://www.r-statistics.com/2013/07/analyzing-your-data-on-the-aws-cloud-with-r/) of mine explaining how to setup an environment for data analysis with R in the AWS cloud.
