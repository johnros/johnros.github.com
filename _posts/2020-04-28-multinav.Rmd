In statistical process control (SPC), one compares some statistic to its "in control" distribution. 
Many statistical and BI software suits (e.g. Tableau, PowerBI) can do SPC, a.k.a. anomaly-detection.
Almost all of these, however, focus on univariate processes, which are easier to visualize and discuss than multivariate processes.
The purpose of our _Multinav_ package is thus to ingest multivariate data streams, compute multivariate summaries, and allow us to query the data interactively when an anomaly is detected. 

Let me demonstrate:


```{r}
rnorm(100)
```
